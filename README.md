# Problem Statement - Productâ€‹

Ecommerce is the buying and selling of products on the internet. The products that are sold on any e-commerce website are the core of the business. Consumers add products to their shopping carts, pay the amount online and buy the products. Sometimes, at the check-out, a consumer may delete a product from the cart, update the count of the products, etc. The application should be able to handle all the consumer requirements to give them a good shopping experience.

## Task

Build a REST API using vanilla JS to manage the product details and add new products, fetch all the products available, fetch a specific product by id, delete a product and update the details of a specific product.

## Running the code

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Execute the `npm start` command to start the application
- Test REST end points on **POSTMAN** (you can use Product-master.postman_collection.json provided on this repository)
